> [!Note]
> The Hmtai api is not fully supported, [why?](https://github.com/cranci1/AnimeGen/blob/main/Privacy/Hmtai.md)
> Same applies to the Waifu.it api, it requires a token.

## Third Party Software

- [SDWebImage](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage): This software is used to handle .gif images for the gallery in the app. Under the [MIT License](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage/blob/master/LICENSE)

## Acknowledgements

- [NineAnimator](https://github.com/SuperMarcus/NineAnimator): Inspired the launch screen idea and provided a base for the app launch screen.
- [Nekidev](https://github.com/Nekidev/anime-api): Provided the anime-api list that helped me find more api to use.

## Build

If you want to build the app yourself, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Xcode installed on your machine.

2. Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/cranci1/AnimeGen
```

3. Navigate to the directory:

```bash
cd AnimeGen
```

3-1. Update the `Secrets.swift` file with your specific values: the Discord Bot Token, a Discord webhook, and your Discord channel ID:

```swift
import Foundation

struct Secrets {
    static var apiToken = "Bot DiscordBotTokenHere"
    static var discordWebhookURL = URL(string: "YourWebhookUrl")!
    static var discordChannelId = "YourChannelIdHere"
    static var waifuItToken = "waifu.it token"
}

```
> Note: This can also be modified directly from the app in the developer section!

4. Run the script:

```
chmod +x ./ipabuild.sh & ./ipabuild.sh
```

If the build was successful, you should see a "build" folder with a subfolder "DerivedDataApp" and the AnimeGen.ipa file in the AnimeGen/build directory. You can now use any IPA installer like TrollStore, AlStore, Scarlet, ESign or sideloadly to install the IPA on the desired device.

> Note: If you encounter any issues during the build, please create an issue I will try my best to help!
